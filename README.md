# Sonification of Asian Stoneware Jars Data

This is a project that was done as part of my INFO-I 310 Multimedia Arts and Technology class at Indiana University South Bend. It is a Max/MSP patch that reads in some of the datafields from an archaeological dataset and produces a sound that fluctuates based on the data. 

Eventually, I would also like to implement a similar idea using open source tools.
