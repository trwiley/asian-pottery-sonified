# Sonification of Asian Stoneware Jars Data

This is a project being done as part of my INFO-I 310 Multimedia Arts and Technology class at Indiana University South Bend. What will be the end-product of this is a Max 7 Patch that reads in some of the datafields from the  dataset and produces a sound that fluctuates based on the data. 

Eventually, I would also like to implement a similar idea in technologies using open-source tools.
